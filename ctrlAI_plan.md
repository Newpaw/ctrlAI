# CtrlAI - Windows Application Plan

## Project Overview
This document outlines the plan for developing a Windows application designed to launch upon pressing specific key combinations (e.g., Alt+t). The application will capture text inputs through commands like Ctrl+c, allowing users to edit the text before sending it to LiteLLM for processing. Once a response is received, the application will display the output, providing users with further editing capabilities and the option to copy the final text.

## 1. Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **Key Combination Launch**: The application should launch with a specific key combination (Alt+t).
- **Text Capture**: Capture text inputs using commands like Ctrl+c (clipboard).
- **Text Editing**: Allow users to edit the captured text before sending it to LiteLLM.
- **LiteLLM Integration**: Send the edited text to LiteLLM and receive responses.
- **Response Display**: Display the response from LiteLLM in the application.
- **Response Editing**: Allow users to edit the response received from LiteLLM.
- **Copy Functionality**: Provide an option to copy the final text to the clipboard.

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: The application should launch quickly upon key press.
- **Usability**: Simple and intuitive user interface.
- **Reliability**: Stable clipboard operations and API interactions.

## 2. Technology Stack

### Programming Language and Libraries
- **Python**: Main programming language
- **keyboard**: Library for detecting key combinations
- **tkinter**: Library for creating the GUI
- **pyperclip**: Library for clipboard operations
- **requests**: Library for making HTTP requests to LiteLLM API

### Development Tools
- **Visual Studio Code**: IDE for development
- **Git**: Version control
- **PyInstaller**: For packaging the application as an executable

## 3. Application Design

### User Interface Design
- **Main Window**: Simple window with text input and output areas
- **Input Area**: Text area for displaying and editing captured text
- **Output Area**: Text area for displaying and editing LiteLLM responses
- **Control Buttons**: 
  - Send button to send text to LiteLLM
  - Copy button to copy the final text
  - Clear button to clear the text areas

### System Architecture
- **Key Listener Module**: Background service to detect key combinations
- **Clipboard Manager**: Component to interact with the system clipboard
- **UI Manager**: Component to handle the graphical user interface
- **LiteLLM Client**: Component to interact with the LiteLLM API
- **Configuration Manager**: Component to handle user preferences and API keys

## 4. Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Setup and Basic Functionality
1. Set up the project structure and environment
2. Implement the key combination listener using the `keyboard` library
3. Create a basic GUI using `tkinter`
4. Implement clipboard interaction to capture text

### Phase 2: LiteLLM Integration
1. Implement the LiteLLM client to send requests and receive responses
2. Add configuration options for API keys and endpoints
3. Integrate the client with the UI

### Phase 3: Advanced Features and Polishing
1. Implement text editing capabilities
2. Add copy functionality for the final text
3. Improve the UI with better styling and user feedback
4. Add error handling and logging

## 5. Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- Test individual components (key listener, clipboard manager, LiteLLM client)
- Ensure each component works as expected in isolation

### Integration Testing
- Test the interaction between components
- Ensure the application works as a whole

### User Acceptance Testing
- Test the application with real users
- Gather feedback and make improvements

## 6. Deployment Plan

### Packaging
- Use PyInstaller to package the application as a Windows executable
- Create an installer for easy distribution

### Distribution
- Create a GitHub repository for the project
- Provide documentation on how to install and use the application

### Maintenance
- Plan for regular updates and bug fixes
- Monitor user feedback and implement improvements

## 7. Project Timeline

| Phase 1 | 1-2 weeks | Setup and basic functionality |
| Phase 2 | 1-2 weeks | LiteLLM integration |
| Phase 3 | 2-3 weeks | Advanced features and polishing |
| Testing | 1 week | Comprehensive testing |
| Deployment | 1 week | Packaging and distribution |
